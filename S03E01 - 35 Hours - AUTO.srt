1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:15,747
The day started like every other. The earth rotated at 1,000 miles an hour. The sprinklers
clicked on at exactly 715. The paint on the garage peeled another 1.2 millimeters.

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:29,980
And Pete and I were hard at work meeting dad's high car wash standards. When suddenly...,...
voice! We need to talk. We didn't do it. Here's a quarter. Call my lawyer. Eddie's.

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:44,772
Pete. Pete. Every man dreams of a chance to say what I'm gonna say to you. A chance to see his
boys become men. To reach that apex. To climb. As usual we had no idea what dad was blamoring

4
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:59,260
on about. But then. I guess what I'm trying to say is your mother and I are going away for the
weekend. We're putting you in charge. The house. The doors. The doors. The doors. The doors.

5
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:35,822
no rules. accept one. beat your job is to protect the house and everything in it especially my most
precious possessions cherish them. love them. but under no circumstances I know I know. don't touch,

6
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:50,710
eat or play with anything that has one of those on. your charge. think you can handle a champ? in
my sleep. well that about covers it missing already. I believe there's just one more little detail.

7
00:02:52,210 --> 00:03:06,215
they were more beautiful than I imagined. they were the keys to paradise. well,
we leave in you as boys. when you come back you'll be men. remember to change

8
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:20,690
your underwear. Joyce, let's go. you have to give them your compliments. your
faith. your trust. I can't do it now. my name is my name is called my precious life.

9
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:38,334
if you love something, set it free. remember
don. the tools are just a phone call

10
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:54,540
away. synchronize. 35 hours in counting.
this is it. just you and me. now begin.

11
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:32,818
it's so beautiful. it's like I've never
been here. it's so hours. I'm scared. I'm

12
00:04:32,830 --> 00:05:03,100
here. three hours into our mega weekend.
I was already out of it. but not pee.

13
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:16,227
he was just warming up. rev it on the red line. the reglie 500 is about
to begin. it was time for the main event. the reglie 500. a gut crunching

14
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:29,740
500 lap race around the house. up till that weekend. it had only been a
dream. but with mom and dad gone nothing could stop us. well, almost nothing.

15
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:44,979
okay. her name was Margie Corso. I had written it a thousand times on my math notebook. and here she was
in my front yard. what are you guys doing? we were just to clean it up. cleaning? there's no cleaning.

16
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:59,260
and there will be no cleaning. we're gonna want the reglie 500. it's okay. I was just seeing if you
wanted to come swimming with me at the quarry. sorry. but brother and I are busy for the next 32 hours.

17
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:15,156
it's the age of Pete. right? right? it's no big deal. I understand if you're out of
play with your little brother. it would be the ultimate betrayal. but this was Margie.

18
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:31,080
she'd a way of tugging her earlobes. did kill with me. it's just a race. we can ride
bikes anytime. you don't mind, do you? I'll tell you what. while I'm gone. the whole house

19
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:50,818
is yours. you're in charge. as that sound. neat, huh? you think you can handle it, champ?
I guess I thought that Pete would understand that I'd been trying to get a date with

20
00:06:50,830 --> 00:07:11,260
Margie since last summer. think again, Johnny. so I said to him, dad. buddy. it's like this.
you scratch my back. I'll scratch yours. wow. the whole house yourself. this morning? I

21
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,263
started with a refrigerator door open for 45
minutes. just because I could. always wanted

22
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:23,000
to do that. you want to come in for some
milk? we can drink straight from the carton.

23
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,323
excuse me sir, can I help you?
no. I live here. that was a funny one.

24
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:38,600
now it's my turn. knock knock. who's
there? not you? the house has been sold.

25
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:54,749
sold? what do you mean? sold. the buyer in the seller reached an equitable agreement in which
the seller waves escrow rights exchange for cash though. huh? let me explain it to you. you don't

26
00:07:54,761 --> 00:08:08,180
live here anymore. your brother sold the house. you got it? it's not brain surgery. I should
know. I used to be a brain surgeon until they fired me. you leave a sandwich inside of one head.

27
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:28,590
my card. Margie, can you give me a second here? I gotta talk to my brother.
you want to come in? no. maybe you two should work this out. besides.

28
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:42,820
milk makes me off learning. we've got water. short pea. we'll spend a
whole weekend together. how could you do this? easy. they met my price.

29
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:57,781
have you lost it? dad's gonna kill us. no? i'm just gonna kill you. you're gonna charge. what's
the liar with you? you grow up? you grow up? good. i feel like a baby now. boys, like i always

30
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:12,800
say. fighting is no way to solve your problems. Roy Kretchmar, and this here is the Mrs and the
two sprouts. where the new owners of your lovely house. how do you like to come in for some book?

31
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:17,723
I'm sorry. You see, there's
been some sort of mistake.

32
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:21,680
My brother's right. I
got to give you these.

33
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:57,310
You're bathroom comes equipped with
matching brass fixtures and deluxe fully

34
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,812
operational toilets.
The plumbing shot.

35
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:02,170
Don't expect to go number
two in either of them.

36
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,270
That won't be a problem.

37
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,230
And here's a place to escape the ups and
downs of the day. Your own secret hideaway.

38
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,049
There's nails poking
down from the ceiling.

39
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:18,210
But you know, it's roomier
than it looks from the outside.

40
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:25,030
Oh, our first phone call.
Cretch my residence.

41
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:30,810
Don't worry. We're just
a phone call in the way.

42
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,390
Cretch my residence.

43
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,270
Hello? Hi, honey.

44
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,610
I'm glad I got you.
How's everything?

45
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,610
Uh, pretty much the same.

46
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,470
Well, don't go selling the
house or anything crazy like that.

47
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,650
Right. Sell the house. Funny.

48
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,430
How'd it go?
Your father's gassed himself again.

49
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,430
How'd call you later? Later.

50
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,624
When? Mom? Like a dog
with a bladder problem.

51
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:18,710
The Cretchmores were
leaving their mark everywhere.

52
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,533
There was no way around
it. I had let my dad down.

53
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:25,410
And if I didn't
stop this insanity,

54
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,830
he was gonna stop me from living.

55
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,590
You're in charge. That's what my dad said.
He trusted me with his whole house.

56
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:43,610
And now I trusted him to take my head off
with a nine iron. What else could go wrong?

57
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,050
How about a garage sale of
all my family's possessions?

58
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,670
What's going on?

59
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,890
Well, like I always say, one man's
trash is another man's treasure.

60
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:01,900
But this is our treasure.
I mean, if you're gonna

61
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:09,670
get rid of all our stuff, why don't you just
have your duty to leave back for a buck?

62
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,950
Sold! Thanks Mr.

63
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,630
Cretchmara. There's so much
nicer than the death use to live here.

64
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,070
But that's my dad. He'll kill you.

65
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,230
You see?

66
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,930
Peter bought you this for your birthday.
What's it doing on the damaged goods table?

67
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,030
Well, it is missing an eye,
but it's yours for 15 cents.

68
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,045
Sold! The Cretchmars were
as unstoppable as a lava flow.

69
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:39,430
If I was gonna get the
house and all our junk back,

70
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,830
I was gonna have to call in the troops.

71
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,230
Count me in.

72
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,430
The Cretchmars have the nicest neighbors on
the block. Why would I want them to leave?

73
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,389
Because if they stay, my family'll
have to leave the neighborhood.

74
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:57,170
And that means Peter
will be gone forever.

75
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,010
They'll be sad and alone
the rest of your miserable life.

76
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,570
Okay, count me in.

77
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,290
Holy moly. Not bad for a buck.

78
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Howdy partner! I'm known as F.

79
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,280
McNamara.

80
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,280
That stands for free range.

81
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,540
I know if they told you this.

82
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,920
But your house is on the
official Wellsville catalog.

83
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:33,640
Nearly full day a step aside, I'll get this
little dog into a lazy garage by something.

84
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,660
Come right in. Like my royal way says.
When you've got fresh cookies,

85
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,940
you can't go wrong with fresh milk.

86
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
Help yourself partner.

87
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:49,100
Come on.

88
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,440
Man, I'm from the fight
the airport committee.

89
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,800
Are you aware that you live under one
of the nation's busiest flight patterns?

90
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,420
And that some airports have shot
at guidelines for luggage control.

91
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,180
Lovely. Like my royal way says,
you can't go wrong with free clothes.

92
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,140
And Billy just loves airplanes.
He's in junior pilot school.

93
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,560
I'll get it.

94
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,680
Pete, just calling to remind you
there's a casserole in the fridge.

95
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,060
Yeah, we found it.

96
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,840
And don't forget, we'll be
home tomorrow at 7 o'clock.

97
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,780
No rush.

98
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,380
The clock was ticking.
In 21 hours, I beat grilled Pete.

99
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,240
I had to get the crutchmores
out, and I had to find a pro.

100
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,280
Into a riggly. All these years I've
known you never treat me as a friend.

101
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,140
Never. And find me in your
house for a cool beverage.

102
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Are you filming? Thanks Mike.

103
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,680
Oh, the boy's the shopper
never going to believe this, huh?

104
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,880
A desperate carrot that
comes to me for hell.

105
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Beautiful.

106
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,800
Say we get down to
business, shall we? I help you.

107
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,260
What's in front
of you? Anything.

108
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,700
You can break everything
in the house, dig up the yard,

109
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,700
contaminated with nuclear waste.

110
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,560
You got any, uh, knee-paulton ice cream.

111
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Good riggly.

112
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Welcome! My nightmare.

113
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480


114
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,700
That night, I expected to find the
crutchmars running for their lives,

115
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,710
and endless Mike standing
atop a pile of furniture

116
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,020
laughing his flames
burst all around him.

117
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Instead.

118
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,450
Man, those crutchmars can't fart.
I don't believe you.

119
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,930
Do you realize this is our last night here?

120
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,810
Mom and Dad trusted us to be
responsible, and now look at us.

121
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,670
It's your fault. I know.
I put you in charge.

122
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,410
I thought you'd have grown up for once.

123
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,518
Oh, so acting grown up
means ditching your brother on

124
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,410
the one most ultimate weekend
we could have ever had.

125
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,050
You're still thinking about that
stupid weekend. Don't you get it?

126
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,130
When mom and dad get back,
we're gonna be grounded for life.

127
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,050
They can't ground us.
We don't have a house.

128
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,500
That's it. I've had enough.
I'm out of here.

129
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,050
One.

130
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,640
What do you think you're doing?

131
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,390
Well, you promised you
yesterday, traitor, the really 500.

132
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,050
Have you lost it?

133
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,270
Mom and Dad are practically on their way
home and you want to ride bikes? Life short.

134
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,330
Live large.

135
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,450
I'm a lap ahead of you.
What are you gonna do about it?

136
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,790
I don't know why I cared,
but if I couldn't get our

137
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,710
house back, the next best
thing was with Pete's butt.

138
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,720
I'm gonna crush you like road kill.

139
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,080
You're gun soil loujec.

140
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,680
Put your nuts, slow head.

141
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,950
I'm not sure when it happened.
Could have been the inside turn on lap 325.

142
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,230
But closing in on Pete, I realized
I was actually having a great time.

143
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:03,110
And I knew why. For me, there's never
been a better friend than my own brother.

144
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,750
Sure, the race ended in a tie, but I
wouldn't have had it any other way.

145
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,950
Nice race.

146
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,470
Yeah, nice race.

147
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,110
I'm sorry, Pete.
I'm sorry I did shit. Never again.

148
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,430
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I sold her a house.

149
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,070
This weekend to do our Riggly 500.
Before dad this owns me.

150
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,470
You won't have to. We still got...

151
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,410
Four minutes?

152
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,310
And a problem is?

153
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,310
Huh? Don't worry. I have plenty.

154
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,870
Oh!

155
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,720
Oh! Isn't this a surprise?

156
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,340
Can we talk to you and Mr.

157
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Cretchmar? Like now?

158
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,580
Well, certainly.

159
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
Oh, Roy!

160
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,360
What can I do for you, fellas?

161
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,740
This is your eviction notice, Roy.

162
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,240
Either you go or the house goes.

163
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,460
Well, I can see you mean business.

164
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,420
Good vision.

165
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,860
You have 10 seconds.

166
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,280
Whoa! Let's not be hasty.

167
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,420
Like I always say.

168
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,140
You don't live here anymore.

169
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,700
With time running out and mom and
dad in sight, there was one option left.

170
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:31,820
Please, please, please.

171
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,660
But this is our home.

172
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,480
Our lives are in these walls.

173
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,160
Like right here, these
notches are repeating.

174
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,810
I would measure ourselves growing up.

175
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,560
And look, these footprints,
they repeat first steps.

176
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,860
We've spent our whole lives in this house.

177
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,920
It's where Pete and I first met.

178
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Please.

179
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
I think I understand.

180
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,460
This house really means a lot to you.

181
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,180
So you sell it back to us? Well.

182
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,540


183
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,620
No! We'll build on the memories.

184
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,060
Oh, Pete, it's a nice milling here.

185
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,190
You've been a good brother.

186
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,600
Now it's the age of Pete.

187
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,860
Hey, daddy!

188
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,180
Congratulations, sons.

189
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Hey, you're wrinkly.

190
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,020
No, no, you're more than wrinkly.

191
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,820
You're men.

192
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,960
Breathe, honest, manly.

193
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,860
Mommy!

194
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,160
Oh, well, what a lovely welcome.

195
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,080
Oh, and who are these nice people?

196
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,680
Say hello to the Kretchmars.

197
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,820
It's so nice to meet you.

198
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,800
You've kept a lovely home.

199
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,620
Oh, so you folks live around here?

200
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,820
You could say that?

201
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Right here, in fact.

202
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,360
Got quite a deal, too.

203
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,700
I don't follow you, stranger.

204
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,180
We kind of sold them the house.

205
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,181
Oh, huh.

206
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,800
After dad calmed down a bed,
he looked at our side of things,

207
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,620
and got even madder.

208
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,621
But a week later,
Mr. Kretchmars was transferred

209
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:34,940
to Alaska, and we
got our house back.

210
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,912
As for Pete and I, we
agreed to spend the

211
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,680
whole weekend together
the next time we get the

212
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:46,280
us to ourselves, which knowing
mom and dad will be in about 30 years.
