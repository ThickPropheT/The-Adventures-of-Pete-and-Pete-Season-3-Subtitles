2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
BIG PETE:
<i>The day started like every other.</i>

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,600
<i>The Earth rotated
at 1,000 miles an hour,</i>

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,800
<i>the sprinklers clicked on
at exactly 7:15,</i>

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>the paint on the garage peeled
another 1.2 millimeters,</i>

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,700
<i>and Pete and I were hard at work
meeting Dad's high car wash standards,</i>

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,400
<i>when suddenly...</i>

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Boys, we need to talk.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,900
Uh we didn't do it.
Here's a quarter, call my lawyer. 

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,800
At ease.
Pete. Pete.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,600
Every man dreams of a chance to say
what I'm gonna say to you.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,200
A chance to see his boys
become men.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,300
To reach that apex.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,400
To climb... <i>( fading into background )</i>

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
BIG PETE:
<i>As usual, we had no idea
what dad was blammering on about.</i>

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,800
<i>But, then...</i>

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,150
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,600
your mother and I
are going away for the weekend.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,700
We're putting you in charge.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,900
The house is yours.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,800

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,500

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,000
¶ Can you settle to shoot me ¶

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,0500
¶ Or have you picked your target yet? ¶

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,300
