00:00:00,9500 --> 00:00:02,000
(Upbeat trumpet playing)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
BIG PETE:
The day started like every other.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,600
The Earth rotated
at 1,000 miles an hour,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,800
the sprinklers clicked on
at exactly 7:15,

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,500
the paint on the garage peeled
another 1.2 millimeters,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,700
and Pete and I were hard at work
meeting Dad's high car wash standards

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,400
when suddenly...

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Boys, we need to talk.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,900
Uh we didn't do it.
Here's a quarter, call my lawyer. 

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,800
At ease.
Pete. Pete.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,600
Every man dreams of a chance to say
what I'm gonna say to you.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,200
{\ 
	does this need to have a `DAD:` annotation, since he's offscreen?
	it's pretty clear he's still talking, but I can hear him doing it, so :shrug:
}
A chance to see his boys
become men.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,300
To reach that apex.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,400
To climb... (fades to background)

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
BIG PETE:
As usual, we had no idea
what dad was blammering on about.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,800
But, then...

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,150
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,600
you're mother and I are going away for the weekend.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,700
We're putting you in charge.

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,900
The house is yours.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,800
("is yours" echoes)

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
(Trumpets crescendo)
