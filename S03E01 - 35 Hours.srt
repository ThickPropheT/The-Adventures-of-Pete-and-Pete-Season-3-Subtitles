BIG PETE:
<i>The day started like every other.</i>

00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,600
<i>The Earth rotated
at 1,000 miles an hour,</i>

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,730
<i>the sprinklers clicked on
at exactly 7:15,</i>

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>the paint on the garage peeled
another 1.2 millimeters,</i>

6
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:21,700
<i>and Pete and I were hard at work
meeting Dad's high car wash standards,</i>

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,400
<i>when suddenly...</i>

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Boys, we need to talk.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,900
Uh we didn't do it.
Here's a quarter, call my lawyer.

10
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:31,800
At ease.
Pete. Pete.

11
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:35,600
Every man dreams of a chance to say
what I'm gonna say to you.

12
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:38,329
A chance to see his boys
become men.

13
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:40,300
To reach that apex.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,400
To climb... <i>( fading into background )</i>

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
BIG PETE:
<i>As usual, we had no idea
what dad was blammering on about.</i>

16
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:47,800
<i>But, then...</i>

17
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:49,150
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,600
your mother and I
are going away for the weekend.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,700
We're putting you in charge.

20
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:55,900
The house is yours.

¶ Hey, smilin' strange ¶

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
¶ You're lookin'
happily deranged ¶

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,000
¶ Can you settle to shoot me ¶

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
¶ Or have you picked your target yet? ¶

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,300
¶ Hey, Sandy ¶

<i>( Jangly rock guitar playing )</i>

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,519
It was what every kid dreams about.

42
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:14,915
Mom and dad were going away
and giving us the house

43
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,231
for 35 unsupervised hours.

44
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:24,537
No parents, no babysitter,
no rules except one.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,535
Pete, your job is to protect the house
and everything in it,

46
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,155
especially my most precious possessions.

47
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,621
Cherish them,
love them,

48
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:36,342
but under no circumstances...
I know, I know.

49
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:40,722
Don't touch, eat, or play with
anything that has one of those on it.

<i>( Ominous trumpets crescendo )</i>

51
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,284
You're in charge.
Think you can handle it, champ?

52
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:45,405
In my sleep.

53
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,801
Well, that about covers it.
Missing you already!

54
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:51,178
I believe there's just
one more little detail.

<i>( Angelic choral singing )</i>

56
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:55,462
They were more beautiful
than I had imagined.

57
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:58,972
They were the keys to paridise.

<i>( Choral singing continues )</i>

59

Welp. We'll be leaving you as boys.
When we come back, you'll be men.

60
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,723
Remember to change your underwear.
Joyce! Let's go.

61
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:11,897
You have to give 'em
your confidence,

62
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,192
your faith,

63
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:14,448
your trust.

Dad, if you love something set it free.
